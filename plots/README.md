# Automation of Plots

This is the main directory housing report automation. Each sub-directory should be broken up into different files, each pertaining to a section of a specific report. If these end up getting too bloated, consider splitting them further (maybe even one file per plot). The plotting files each house one function per plot. Study up on the structure and use them as a template moving forward for new plots.

In order to run the plots and collect an output, run the file `plots.py`. That will handle everything. It should be pretty straightforward to extend.
